## Laravel哲学

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching.

Laravel的目标是给开发者创造一个愉快的开发过程，并且不牺牲应用的功能性。快乐的开发者才能创造最棒的代码。为了这个目的，我们取众框架之长处集中到Laravel中，这些框架甚至是基于Ruby on Rails、ASP.NET MVC、和Sinatra等开发语言或工具的。

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## 学习Laravel

One of the best ways to learn Laravel is to read through the entirety of its documentation. This guide details all aspects of the framework and how to apply them to your application.

In addition to this guide, you may wish to check out some [Laravel books](http://wiki.laravel.io/Books). These community written books serve as a good supplemental resource for learning about the framework:
